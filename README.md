Department: Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
Institution: Khulna University of Engineering and Technology (KUET)

1. Project Overview

This project is a console-based ATM Management System implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.
It simulates real-world ATM functionalities such as depositing, withdrawing, transferring money, and displaying user account details.

2. Key Features

Deposit money into an account

Withdraw money from an account with balance validation

Transfer funds between two accounts

Display user and account details

Transaction tracking through class-based implementation

3. Concepts Used

Class and Object implementation

Friend functions and friend classes

Encapsulation and data hiding

Constructor initialization

Composition (ATM containing Bank and Account objects)

Menu-driven program design

4. Classes Implemented

Transaction – Handles transaction details (ID, type, amount)

Bank – Manages bank-level operations and balance control

Account – Stores account information and balance per user

ATM – Integrates all components and provides user interface

5. How to Run

Open the project in any C++ compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or VS Code).

Compile the code:

g++ atm.cpp -o atm


Run the executable:

./atm


Follow the on-screen menu to perform transactions.

6. Future Improvements

Persistent data storage using file handling

Enhanced transaction history feature

User authentication system

GUI-based ATM interface

7. Purpose

This project was developed for educational purposes to demonstrate practical implementation of OOP concepts in C++ and to strengthen programming and system design skills.
